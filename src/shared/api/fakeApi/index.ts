Citing ongoing power outages at about 100 campuses, district officials announced they will not resume classes on Tuesday. They said they hope to reopen Wednesday.

“The power is the biggest issue now,” spokesperson Tanya Arja said, adding that the decision about Wednesday could change if too many schools continue to go without electricity.

Other factors complicating the district’s reopening include standing water in about a dozen schools, delayed deliveries of food for cafeterias and road hazards and traffic signal outages in several communities.`
